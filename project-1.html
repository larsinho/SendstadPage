				<p class="tags">Investment in emerging technologies is particularly challenging,
					since, apart from uncertainty in revenue streams, firms must also take into account
					both policy uncertainty and the random arrival of innovations. We assume that the former
					is reflected in the sudden provision and retraction of a support scheme, which takes the
					form of a fixed premium on top of the output price. Thus, we develop an analytical framework for
					sequential investment in order to determine how price, technological, and policy uncertainty interact
					to affect the decision to invest sequentially in successively improved versions of an emerging technology.
					We show that greater likelihood of subsidy retraction lowers the incentive to invest, whereas greater
					 of subsidy provision facilitates investment. However, embedded options to invest in improved technology
					 versions raise the value of the investment opportunity, thereby mitigating the impact of subsidy retraction
					 and making the impact of subsidy provision more pronounced. Additionally, by allowing for sequential policy
					 interventions, we find that the impact of policy uncertainty becomes less pronounced as the number of
					 policy interventions increases.
